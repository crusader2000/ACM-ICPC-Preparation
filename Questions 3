Due date: TBA
Problem Statement:
In the city of Bacteriapur lives bacterias which are known to have a fast growing
mechanism. For every time instant t, the number of bacterias living in Bacteriapur gets incremented by
t times the current population. (starting with initial population, P 0 = 1). Your task is to calculate the
population of Bacteriapur at a given time instant t.
Input
First line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Each of the next T lines contains an
integer t, denoting the time instant at which population of Bacteriapur needs to be calculated.
Output
For each test case, output a single integer denoting the population of Bacteriapur after the given time
instant t
