Problem Statement:
Students of IIIT-H like to read a lot. So, the library is their favourite place in
the world. They check out books very often and this has become a problem for the librarian. The librarian
is a dumb computer science person, who likes to keep the track of the number of times a book has been
checked out. There are N books in the library numbered from 1 to N. Usually, students like to check out a
series of consecutive books. So in a given transaction, a student checks out all books between index L and
R (inclusive). Not only that, they generally checks out these books many times, because they like the books
that much. After Q such studious students come into the library, can you help our librarian figure out which
book had been checked out the least number of times?
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and Q, the number of books and the
number of studious students. Each of the next Q lines contains three space-separated integers L, R and X,
the leftmost book number, the rightmost book number and the number of times the student checks out
these books.
Output
Return the book number which had been checked out the least number of times. If there are many such
books, return the least book number.
Constraints
